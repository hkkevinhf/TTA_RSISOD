# TTA_RSISOD
Learning to Adapt Using Test-Time Images for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images (TGRS))

The saliency maps can be downloaded at: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Ky6RBTPZvaV8jYvf_xSxww (code: 9jp5).
saliency_maps.zip include saliency maps on clean RSI data.
saliency_maps_corruption.zip include saliency maps on corrupted RSI data.

The corrupted RSI data (including Gaussian blur, Gaussian noise, contrast reduction) can also be downloaded.
